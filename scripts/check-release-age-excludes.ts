/**
 * Assert that every `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` carve-out is still justified.
 *
 * `minimumReleaseAge` (pnpm-workspace.yaml) is a supply-chain gate: a freshly
 * published version cannot enter the lockfile until it has survived in the wild
 * for the configured window, which is the cheapest defence there is against a
 * compromised release. `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` punches a hole in that gate
 * for one package.
 *
 * Those holes are meant to be temporary — you take one when a security fix
 * lands and the only patched version is younger than the window, i.e. exactly
 * when you are *most* exposed to a malicious publish. Once the version ages
 * past the window the exclusion is pure downside: it silently keeps that one
 * package exempt forever, and nothing in the toolchain complains. A comment
 * saying "drop this after the 26th" is not a control; nobody re-reads
 * pnpm-workspace.yaml on the 26th.
 *
 * So each entry must carry a machine-readable expiry:
 *
 *     minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
 *       # GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz: fast-uri 3.1.4 (released 2026-07-19) is the only
 *       # version that clears the advisory and is <7 days old.
 *       # drop-after: 2026-07-26
 *       - fast-uri
 *
 * The marker may also trail the entry itself (`- fast-uri # drop-after: ...`).
 *
 * This check fails when an entry has no `drop-after:` marker, when the date is
 * unparseable, when that date has passed, or when the list is written in flow
 * style (`[fast-uri]`) where this parser could not see it — turning a stale or
 * invisible carve-out into a red build instead of a permanent silent exemption.
 *
 * Removing an expired entry is normally all that is required: by definition the
 * fixed version is now older than the window, so it no longer needs the hole.
 * Re-run `pnpm install` after deleting it to confirm.
 *
 * The same expiry contract covers `auditConfig.ignoreGhsas`, the only sanctioned
 * way to pass `pnpm audit` over a high/critical advisory that has no patched
 * release (docs/development.md).
 * An expired suppression means "go look upstream again": delete it once a fix
 * ships, or re-date it after re-checking. Any other `auditConfig` key (notably
 * `ignoreCves`) is rejected, so every suppression goes through this check.
